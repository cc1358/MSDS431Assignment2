We compare regresion analysis with the Anscombe's Quartet using given Python and R methods (See Miller 2015) to a construction in Go. From VSCode, the Python execution time the program can consistenly run around 3 seconds. R is much more efficent with a runtime consistenly under 0.5 seconds. Go runtimes appear to signficantly outperform Python, and the runtimes match R by running under 0.5 seconds. We also have a seperate test .go file that runs tests for the Go linear regression functions. Beyond this, we create an anscombeapp.go file that allows for the creation of a basic interactive app that prompts the user to enter a column from the quartet and return regression coefficents. As expected, the regression results return the desired results.
